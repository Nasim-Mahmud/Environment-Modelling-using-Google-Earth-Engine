# Environment-Modelling-using-Google-Earth-Engine
Here, I have made a model to process image classification of the environment of Bangladesh using GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE. From there, I have used the data of the different times of a year. To run this project, you must have access to Earth Engine Code Editor. To have access to Earth Engine Code editor, you must have to sign in [Earth Engine]( https://earthengine.google.com/). 
Earth Engine uses the Javascript programming language. To learn more about JS in Earth Engine, you can follow the link below:
