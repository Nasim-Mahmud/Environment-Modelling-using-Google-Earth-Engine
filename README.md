# Environment-Modelling-using-Google-Earth-Engine
Here, I have made a model of the environment of Bangladesh using GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE. From there, I have used the data of the different times of a year. To run this project, you must have access to Earth Engine Code Editor. To have access to Earth Engine Code editor, you must have to sign in [Earth Engine]( https://earthengine.google.com/).
